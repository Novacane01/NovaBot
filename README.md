# NovaBot
This project was a chat bot made in Python for the program Slack.

# How it works
Over the course of several weeks I had the program collect message data from various users using the Slack API and store it in a postgreSQL database.
After a sufficient amount of data had been collected, I created an algorithm that for every message sent in the application would parse through the entire database and find a suitable response to reply to the user.
